# WebApp

*WebApp* provides the user interface for interacting with the payroll application.

## Business Case

*payroll* needs to have a user interface that will allow the user to access the functionalities of the application. The web application that is going to be build need to be:

- Re-Usable, similar components are greatly encapsulated, or we can say self-sufficient, so we can reuse them on different parts of an app.
- Readable, we can read the code better and reach productivity faster.
- Maintainable, the components that are easily decoupled from each other can be easily replaced with better implementation. So it is easier to maintain and update code within the iterative development workflow

## Technology

- NodeJs [version:v13.9.0] (the JavaScript runtime environment)
- NPM [version:6.13.7] (the package manager for the JavaScript programming language)
- Javascript [version: ES9] (the programming language for building web application)
- Angular [version:10.0.4] (the platform for building the web application)

## Architecture

## Implementation Details


## Setup

Prerequisite needed before setup:

- NodeJs [version:v13.9.0] (should be installed)
- NPM [version:6.13.7] (should be installed)
- payroll [] (all payroll services should be started and running)
